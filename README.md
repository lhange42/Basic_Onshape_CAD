## Base

### Description 
  In this assignment the task was to create the base of a caster using Onshape.

### Lessons Learned 
  This assignment was an introduction into the CAD program Onshape. I learned the basic information about how to sketch, extrude, dimension, and linear pattern. I was able to figure it out its very similar to SolidWroks just that the toolbar is slightly different and also that its in the cloud so you dont have to worry about manually saving.

## Mount

### Description 
  This assignment you create a mount used to connect the base to the wheel system using Onshape.

### Lessons Learned 
  This assignment was similar to the first one where you use simple sketching, extruding, and linear patterns. One new thing I did learn is how to use variables on Onshape, YOu can set dimensions as variables by using # and then the variables name.

## Fork 

### Description 
  In this assignment the task was to create the part that the base and mount holds and its the piece that contains the wheel.

### Lessons Learned 
  In this lesson I learned how to fillet and chamfer in Onshape. I discovered that in fillets and Chamfers you can have tangent propagation and this automatically selects any connecting lines and makes fillets and chamfers even easier.
