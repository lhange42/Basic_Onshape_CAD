## Base

### Description 
  In this assignment the task was to create the base of a caster using Onshape.

### Lessons Learned 
  This assignment was an introduction into the CAD program Onshape. I learned the basic information about how to sketch, extrude, dimension, and linear pattern. I was able to figure it out its very similar to SolidWroks just that the toolbar is slightly different and also that its in the cloud so you dont have to worry about manually saving.
